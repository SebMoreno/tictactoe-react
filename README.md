# React Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game built with React.

There are 4 different implementations of the game, each in a different branch depending on if they use TypeScript or not, and if they use React Hooks or not:

`master-hooks-ts`: React Hooks + TypeScript.

`hooks-js`: React Hooks + JavaScript.

`classbased-ts`: React Class Components + TypeScript.

`classbased-js`: React Class Components + JavaScript.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
